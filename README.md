# Weather Report Arduino Program
## By James Hill
## Purpose: 
## This Arduino program is designed to retrieve temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor and send it to a Firebase database. It is part of the Weather Report Android Application.

## Technologies Used
### Arduino Uno WiFi Rev.2: Arduino board used for the project.
### DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module: Sensor module used to measure temperature and humidity.
### WiFiNINA Library: Library for connecting the Arduino to a WiFi network.
### Firebase: Real-time database used to store and retrieve sensor data.
### Config Library: Library for configuring Firebase connection.
### Firebase_Arduino_WiFiNINA Library: Library for interfacing Arduino with Firebase.
### Firebase_TCP_Client Library: Library for handling TCP connections with Firebase.
### WCS Library: Library for handling sensor data.
